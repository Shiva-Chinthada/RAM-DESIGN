Random Access Memory (RAM) is a crucial component of digital systems, providing temporary storage for data and instructions used by processors. In this project, a RAM module is designed and implemented using Verilog. The design includes defining memory arrays, implementing read and write operations controlled by address and control signals, and ensuring synchronous access using clock signals. The project also involves simulating the RAM behavior to verify correct data storage and retrieval. This work demonstrates practical aspects of memory design in hardware, illustrating how RAM can be implemented, tested, and integrated into larger digital systems using Verilog.
